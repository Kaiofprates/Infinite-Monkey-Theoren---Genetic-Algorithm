## Infinite Monkey Theorem - Genetic Algorithm
>  
Genetic algorithm based on the Infinite Monkey Theorem. Code translated into the Javascript language of the original in Java created by Daniel Shiffman.

###### The “infinite monkey theorem” is stated as follows: A monkey hitting keys randomly on a typewriter will eventually type the complete works of Shakespeare (given an infinite amount of time). The problem with this theory is that the probability of said monkey actually typing Shakespeare is so low that even if that monkey started at the Big Bang, it’s unbelievably unlikely we’d even have Hamlet at this point.
